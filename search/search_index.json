Consider the history of IDEs: while many groundbreaking early applications no longer exist, but their innovations laid the foundation for modern development environments. Some of the novel projects that exist today, like VIM and NeoVIM, were once the same project, but diverged at core points and now exist separately using different roadmaps. The projects often pull inspiration from one another, but are different entities. At its core, Open-Access 3.0 is straightforward: distributed reads and writes around cloud-optimized datasets. However, as we saw at AGU this year, this simple idea can become complex when datasets expand across spatial and temporal dimensions and increase in parameter count. Just as the IDE landscape eventually settled into a few dominant platforms while maintaining room for specialized tools, I believe Open-Access 3.0 will follow suit. Some platforms may emerge as standards, particularly for specific scientific domains or data types. However, the diversity of scientific computing needs means there will always be value in creating new approaches.

Sometimes he mixes two kinds of ales together, sometimes his ale bucket is more complicated or simpler, but he is always losing his ale. Poor guy.

I spend weeks staring at a computer screen, writing code, processing data, and thinking through discretization of Sir Edmond's ale bucket. I went out to do some field work for a different project in the Carmel River Watershed, a valley I've been to a dozen times. But after spending so much time thinking about this watershed digitally, well really just a digital bucket representing the watershed, a sense of dred came over me as I looked down the Carmel Valley (Figured below). I was realizing how much my precious computer model was missing, seeing the errors in my assumptions, the variety of vegetation in areas my models represents as homogeneous, the property boundaries with drainage features. Nothing in the analog system seemed to match my digitization. There is overwhelming complexity in every watershed, river reach and hillslope, if our eyes are open.  </p> <p> </p> <p>But in hydrology, we consider representing a delayed flow of water as a bucket a type of physical conceptualization. And as a matter of fact, this goes back a long way to Instantaneous Unit Hydrograph (IUH). In my MS level hydrology class, we learned that the IUH from linear reservoirs turns into a beta distribution (Nash 1960). This is a type of theoretical physical understanding of hydrology through buckets.  </p> <p>The equation for the Instantaneous Unit Hydrograph (IUH) from linear reservoirs is:  </p> \\[ q(t) = \\frac{t^{n-1} e^{-t/k}}{k^n \\Gamma(n)} \\] <p>Where \\(q(t)\\) is the flow rate at time \\(t\\), k is the storage coefficient (related to the delay in each reservoir), \\(n\\) is the number of reservoirs (controls the shape of the hydrograph), \\(\\Gamma(n)\\) is the gamma function.  </p> <p>The physical intuition is 1) the \\( n \\) reservoirs represent sequential storage compartments (or \u201cbuckets\u201d) that delay and attenuate flow as water moves downstream, and 2) each bucket\u2019s outflow becomes the inflow for the next, creating a cascade effect that smooths and delays the hydrograph.

Physicists knew this because the theory, when taken to the thermodynamic limit, didn't match observation data. This gap between theory and experiment ultimately inspired a revolutionary shift in conceptualization, paving the way for modern quantum mechanics, and improving our understanding of the natural world.  </p>"},{"location":"blog/hydrology-is-flat-and-its-buckets-all-the-way-down/#taking-buckets-to-their-limit","title":"Taking buckets to their limit","text":"<p>The mathematical structure of a system of buckets flowing into each other is the correct physical model of one type of system only, and that is, of course, a system of buckets flowing into each other. However, applying this model to a watershed is an approximation, much like using harmonic oscillators to model blackbody radiation. While it works under certain conditions, we know it\u2019s not a true representation of how the natural world behaves.  </p> <p>But let's take this idea of buckets flowing into each other a bit more seriously as a representation of a fundamental unit process of hydrology. When I am out on Carmel Valley Road overlooking the watershed, I see depressions, gullies, rills, blades of grass, everything else. All these individual processes do somewhat behave as oddly shaped buckets. A blad of grass, for instance, does collect moisture from the air, and that moisture does flow down the blade. A prarie pothole also fills up and overflows, bucket-like, yet some water flows down through the leaking bottom. Though these are not perfectly round reservoirs with known leaks with known coefficients, they do all sort of flow into each other. I used this idea to try to bring neural networks into hydrology from a more realistic conceptualization. With differentiable modeling (Shen et al., 2023), we can set up our neural network to behave like these systems of buckets, complete with valves on the spigots determining the flow coefficient (weights), and the water level dropping below the spigot shutting off flow completely (activation). What I think we are left with here is a pretty darn good digital interpretation of a messy, complex, heterogeneous system (image below from Frame et al., 2024).  </p> <p></p> <p>Each individual bucket in our Nash Cascade Neural Network behaves like a mass concerving perceptron (Wang et al., 2024). In this scenario, we end up with a model that has the uncanney ability to match a downstream diagnostic variable very well, and we have utilized the hydrologists tool of choice. But if we look closely, are we not simply re-creating a neural network? And if so, can we re-think the neural network as a conceptual model?  </p> <p>We've seen overwhelming evidence in the past few decades that neural networks are more accurate at predicting hydrologic responses than the conceptualization of hydrologic systems as buckets (Nearing et al., 2020). The predictive power of bucket-based conceptualizations can themselves be enhanced through integration with neural networks (Shen et al., 2023). So much, in fact, the neural network is more important than the bucket (Acu\u00f1a Espinoza et al., 2024). What I've always pondered is what would happen if hydrologists simply rejected conceptualizations that are demonstratively poor predictors (i.e., rejected hypotheses; Beven 2018 and 2019), and in their place we embrace the architectures leading to better predictions when compared observations (e.g., neural networks) as a new conceptualization. There is often a sentiment that the bucket conceptualizations, even as simplifications, are \"interpretable\", but an interpretation is only usefull if we are honest about them limitations. We still learn the Rayleigh\u2013Jeans law in thermodynamics, but we then understand the limitations of the continuous energy conceptualization and turn to Planck's Law to grasp the quantum reality. We can still learn bucket conceptualizations, but let's not pretend that they are \"physical\" representations. So far we've failed to reject neural networks as hydrology models, can we build our hydrologic conceptualizations around these architectures?  </p>"},{"location":"blog/hydrology-is-flat-and-its-buckets-all-the-way-down/#buckets-as-toy-models-as-an-educational-tool-and-for-hypothesis-testing","title":"Buckets as toy models, as an educational tool, and for hypothesis testing","text":"<p>One thing we can do with our digital buckets is use these simple concepts to explore complex ideas.

They represent a convenient unit that we can manipulate and modify to study complex behaviors in an otherwise overwhelming system.

It is engaging, simplifies abstract ideas, and makes them accessible to a wide audience.</p> <p>In hydrology, one of the most simple yet elegant conceptualization of soil-water dynamics is the soil moisture loss function, a model developed by Laio et al. (2001) and Rodriguez-Iturbe et al. (1999). This model abstract complex soil processes at the field scale into a few key variables, providing ecohydrologists with a powerful 'toy model' for conducting a variety of interesting experiments. For example, Entekhabi and Rodriguez-Iturbe (1994) explored the impacts of spatio-temporal aggregation on characterizing heterogeneity of soil moisture dynamics. D'Odorico and Porporato (2004) used it to explain soil moisture seasonality.  </p> <p>In this blog post, I'll animate this soil dynamics model, with Part 1 focusing on the basic concepts.  Animations in this blog post will illustrate how hydrologists conceptualize the soil processes happening just above and beneath our feet,  while also exploring how these processes unfolds across different conceptual spaces. </p>"},{"location":"blog/soils-animated-part-1/#soil-moisture-loss-function-to-describe-the-dynamics","title":"Soil Moisture Loss Function to Describe the Dynamics","text":"<p>The soil moisture loss function (Laio et al., 2001);Rodriguez-Iturbe et al., 1999) relates the rate of loss from soil volume (\\(-\\frac{d\\theta}{dt}\\)) at a given soil moisture level (\\(\\theta\\)). It is a type of Storage-Flux relation model in Hydrology, linking how Fluxes (in this case, drainage and evapotranspiration) are regulated by Storage (soil moisture) availability. The model describes two key stages: Drainage and Evapotranspiration (note: For simplicity, hygroscopic water are neglected in this blog post).</p>"},{"location":"blog/soils-animated-part-1/#drainage-stage","title":"Drainage Stage","text":"<p>Imagine the soil after a rainstorm. Immediately after rainfall ceases, soil is saturated or extremely wet\u2014if you step on it, it is muddy and squishy. In this state, both soil macropores and micropores are filled with water, and water in the macropores drains quickly due to gravity. Some water may also run off the surface. The first stage of the loss function represents this state, and this rapid processes are expressed as an exponential function. </p> <p> Figure 1: Simulated soil moisture dynamics during the Drainage stage in two different conceptual spaces.  </p>"},{"location":"blog/soils-animated-part-1/#evapotranspiration-stage","title":"Evapotranspiration Stage","text":"<p>After a few days, the soil transitions to a semi-dry state\u2014it still feels moist to the touch, but no water seeps out. At this point, water in the soil macropores are mostly drained, and water is held against gravity in the soil micropores due to soil suction forces.</p> <p>In this stage, the dominant flux is evapotranspiration (ET). Initially, when the soil is wet, ET occurs at its maximum rate because plant stomata are fully, open, and the transpiration process reaches its maximum rate (note: though evaporation can continue independently; Krell et al., 2021). As the soil dries, a critical soil moisture threshold \\(\\theta^*\\) is reached, where plants begin to experience water stress. Below that point, ET decreases proportionally with soil moisture level (although this can be nonlinear; Araki et al., 2024). These ET dynamics are represented by the piecewise-linear function in the loss function space. This is much slower process compared to the Drainage, as you can see below: </p> <p> Figure 2: Simulated soil moisture dynamics during the Evapotranspiration stage in two different conceptual spaces.  </p>"},{"location":"blog/soils-animated-part-1/#usefulness-of-the-soil-moisture-loss-function","title":"Usefulness of the Soil Moisture Loss Function","text":"<p>This loss function model treats soil volume as a system responding to pulse inputs of rainfall (which I plan to elaborate on and animate in Part 2). The model describes how soil responds in a prescribed manner based on the combination of its physical properties, external forcing, and current  state. The drydown curve is the realization of the system partially activated by a rainfall pulse. </p> <p>Because the loss function is an ordinary differential equation (ODE), we can transition between two perspectives. </p> <ol> <li> <p>System Space (Left panels in the above animations): represents general patterns of the soil system, i.e., the loss function. </p> </li> <li> <p>Observable Space (Right panels in the above animations): describes soil moisture drying behavior, which are measurable with sensors.

The animation below shows how Gaussian noise in the sample observation points  impacts loss estimates. This situation calls for bivariate analysis but they are more difficult to implement. One of the ways to deal with the bivariate uncertainties is to use the Bayesian approaches as implemented by Bassiouni et al., (2020).</p> <p> Figure 3: Estimating the soil moisture loss function from a sample point with Gaussian noise, from the loss function space.  </p> <p>In the observable space (which is the analytical solution of the loss function), the x-variable becomes sampling timing\u2014a deterministic quantity.
